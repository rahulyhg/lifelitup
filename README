This is the LifeLitUp application source-code.

This project was once a great project to work on, until we got jobs...

The aim of this project was to create a website where users would upload 'evidence' of them being some place/doing
something that was on our website. You know that book, '1001 movies to watch before you die'? LifeLitUp was going 
to be the same sort of thing, but with a very wide-range of things to see or do. (i.e. jetskiing, mountain biking, 
visit Germany).

The code sucks. There is no architecture. You'll be able to get it working... maybe. Yes, there's heaps of bugs,
and bad security practices, but we've come a long way since. :-)

There's a domain name that accompanies this code has since expired.

Have fun.
